## Introduction

The generic open source PDK is a collaboration between Mabrains and Gdsfactory to provide a fully open source process design kit (PDK) and related resources to enable the creation of photonic designs manufacturable.


## Current-Status

> :warning: We are currently treating the current content as an **experimental preview!**

The PDK will be tagged with a production version when ready to do production design.

## Generic-PDK

This repository contains the full pdk inspired from Gdsfactory generic technology.

This includes:

 * Schematic symbols
 * DRC
 * LVS
 * Pcells

 Currently it supports;

  * For Schematic:
     - Xschem
  * For DRC/LVS/Pcells:
     - Klayout

## Prerequisites

At a minimum:

- python 3.10+
- python3-venv
- klayout 0.29.0+
- xschem V3.1.0+

## Installation

To begin, create a new directory that will contain all GenericPDK setup files and environment configurations:

```bash
mkdir generic_pdk_setup && cd generic_pdk_setup/
```

Next, clone the project into the current directory you have created:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mabrains/gdsfactory-generic-pdk
```

Afterward, you will need to create a python virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv ./generic_pdk_env && source ./generic_pdk_env/bin/activate
```

And then:

```bash
cd gdsfactory-generic-pdk
```

Subsequently, to install the required Python packages, execute the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Lastly, to install the Generic-PDK for the KLayout tool, execute the following commands:

```bash
python3 install_tech.py --tech_path=$PWD/klayout/ --klayout_home=$PWD/../generic_pdk_klayout --python_env=$PWD/../generic_pdk_env/ 
```

This will install the Generic-PDK technology in the KLayout tool. You can then open it by executing the following command:

> **Note**: Open a new terminal before executing the following command.

```bash
klayout_generic_pdk
```

Alternatively, to open a pre-existing layout, you can use the following command:

```bash
klayout_generic_pdk <your_layout_file>
```

Example:

```bash
klayout_generic_pdk klayout/lvs/testing/testcases/unit/lidar_device/lidar.gds
```

You will observe that the PDK has been added to KLayout, as illustrated in Figure 1.

## Usage

Please refer to [xschem-symbols](./xschem/README.md) for more information about symbols usage.

Please refer to [klayout](./klayout/README.md) for more information about DRC/LVS/PCells usage.
